You know how it is with your favourite TV series – it is the unexpected twist that keeps you hooked. I believe that one of those twists is happening to me right now.
My name is Irina and I am a soon-to-be front-end developer. Let me share a few details of my background.

About 17 years ago I graduated from the Russian State University for Economy and Trade with the degree of an Economist. I then worked for several years for a bank as a financial analyst. I got promoted several times, but then I had a change of heart.

I got Master’s degree in teaching, took two Cambridge Teaching Knowledge tests, moved to the countryside and started teaching English. I taught English to a variety of students, focusing then on teaching corporate groups as well as individual students. 

About three years ago, when the world was changing, I felt an urge to change too. I remembered my long-forgotten passion for coding which went back to my university years when I was top of class in coding. And I remembered this euphoric feeling when my code worked. Of course, back then I did not think this could be part of my life.

About a year ago I took a course on Python. This was quite a superficial course, but we covered the basics of Python, HTML, CSS and SQL. After finishing the course, I understood that I quite liked it and wanted to dig deeper into it. I started to look for opportunities. Then my brother told me that there is this Rolling Scopes School which is extremely tough but gives you wonderful results and I should definitely try it.

Try it I did and I was overwhelmed by the amount of information we needed to consume in short periods of time. And the first task – The Coffee House – showed me that I was way out of my depth. I was struggling. 
I eventually completed the task and this is what the final version looks like.

But little by little, bit by bit, I got the grip of how to use Figma and PerfectPixel, got more confident with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and the final tasks, where we had to develop the games Hangman and Nonograms, added quite some points to my score.

Here is the classic Hangman game with the virtual keyboard implementation.

And here is the Nonogram game which took me two weeks to build and involves such features as timer, saving last five win results, resetting the game and showing the answers.

All in all, I believe that coding is an extremely rewarding process. You rack your brain to find the perfect algorithm for your task – and then you find it! Isn’t that one of the most wonderful things ever!

And although I believe that there is still a lot for me to learn, I am really willing to do so. I am eager to develop.

Thank you for your time.
